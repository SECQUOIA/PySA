**PySA** is an extensible platform to optimize classical cost function.

PySA is a heuristic solver that does not provide bounds or guarantees on optimality of solutions.

## Getting Started

Tutorials on how to use **PySA** can be found in
[pysa/tutorials](https://github.com/nasa/pysa/tree/main/tutorials).

## Available Modules

**PySA** provides multiple modules that can be independently installed:
* Generator of Random McEliece instances ([pysa-mceliece](https://github.com/nasa/PySA/tree/pysa-mceliece))
* Stern Algorithm to solve unstructured decoding problems ([pysa-stern](https://github.com/nasa/PySA/tree/pysa-stern))
* Branch-and-Bound Library with Workload Autobalance Between Threads and Nodes ([pysa-branching](https://github.com/nasa/PySA/tree/pysa-branching))
* WalkSAT algorithm for SAT problems ([pysa-walksat](https://github.com/nasa/PySA/tree/pysa-walksat))
* DPLL Implementation for SAT based on `pysa-braching` ([pysa-dpll](https://github.com/nasa/PySA/tree/pysa-dpll))

## Installation

**PySA** can be installed by using `pip` directly from the `GitHub` 
repository:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/nasa/pysa
```
using a `zip` file:
```
pip install pysa.zip
```
or by using `conda`:
```
conda env create -f envinronment.yml
```

## Testing and CI

**PySA** uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline includes:

- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests run on Python 3.8 through 3.12
- **Code Coverage**: Coverage reports are generated and tracked
- **Code Formatting**: YAPF ensures consistent code style
- **Examples Validation**: All example scripts are tested automatically
- **Tutorial Execution**: Jupyter notebooks are executed to ensure they work

### Running Tests Locally

To run the test suite locally:

```bash
pip install -e . pytest pytest-cov
pytest tests/
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=pysa --cov-report=html tests/
```

### CI Workflows

The repository includes several CI workflows:

- **CI** (`ci.yml`): Main comprehensive workflow that runs all checks
- **Code Coverage** (`coverage.yml`): Generates detailed coverage reports
- **Python PyTest** (`python-pytest.yml`): Runs unit tests across all Python versions
- **Python Code Formatting** (`python-yapf.yml`): Validates code formatting
- **Python Examples** (`python-example.yml`): Tests example scripts
- **Python Tutorials** (`python-tutorials.yml`): Executes tutorial notebooks

All workflows are triggered on pushes to `main` and on pull requests.
